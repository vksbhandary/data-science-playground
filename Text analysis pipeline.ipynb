    "This notebook aims to create a simple, repeatable text analysis pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main focus of analysis will be:\n",
    "- check the number of columns and rows (filter columns that we don't need)\n",
    "- check rows with missing data/text\n",
    "- find the minimum, maximum, and average length of the input text\n",
    "- presence of multi-lingual text (if focus is only on English data)\n",
    "- presence of toxic comment or text (to check if data is safe for further usage)\n",
    "- check the overall sentiment of each row of text\n",
    "- check if we need to clean data (by checking things we don't need in our dataset moving forward)\n",
    "- check the common theme of the text\n",
    "\n",
    "After keeping your topic of concern in mind, create more curious questions regarding the type of data you are trying to analyze. If the dataset is related to a particular field, create multiple curious questions to better understand your dataset and find meaningful insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have a customer review dataset, you can identify which country/city has the most negative reviews, which would be helpful for understanding where the company needs to focus more generally. Similarly, you can think of common issues mentioned in customer reviews to fix issues."
